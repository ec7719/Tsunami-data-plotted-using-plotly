# Tsunami-data-plotted-using-plotly
In Python, you can analyze tsunami data using various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. First, you would need to import the data into a Pandas dataframe. You can then use NumPy to perform calculations on the data, such as finding the mean and standard deviation.
To visualize the data, you can use Matplotlib to create plots and graphs. For example, you could create a scatter plot of the tsunami data, with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis representing the height of the waves. You could also create a histogram to show the frequency of different wave heights.

Additionally, you could use machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn to build predictive models based on the tsunami data. These models could be used to forecast future tsunamis and assess potential risks.
